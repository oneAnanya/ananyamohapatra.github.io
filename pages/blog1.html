                    <strong>Database:</strong>
                    <p>A database is a structured collection of data stored in a computer system. It allows for efficient storage, retrieval, and management of data. In our example, the database would be an institute's student management system containing all the student records.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Table:</strong>
                    <p>A table is a collection of related data entries that consists of columns and rows within a database. Each table represents a specific type of data. For our example, the table might be named "Students" and it includes the following data:</p>
                    <table>
                        <tr>
                            <th>Name</th>
                            <th>Student ID</th>
                            <th>Course</th>
                            <th>Duration</th>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Ankita</td>
                            <td>101</td>
                            <td>PGDCA</td>
                            <td>6 months</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Ananya</td>
                            <td>102</td>
                            <td>Full Stack</td>
                            <td>6 months</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Archita</td>
                            <td>103</td>
                            <td>BI</td>
                            <td>8 months</td>
                        </tr>
                    </table>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Degree:</strong>
                    <p>The degree of a table refers to the number of columns (attributes) it has. In our "Students" table, there are 4 columns: Name, Student ID, Course, and Duration. Therefore, the degree of this table is 4.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Cardinality:</strong>
                    <p>The cardinality of a table refers to the number of rows (records) it contains. In our "Students" table, there are 3 rows, each representing a different student. Therefore, the cardinality of this table is 3.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            
            <h2>Keys in a Relational Table</h2>
            <p>In a relational table, different types of keys help to uniquely identify and organize data. Using an example from an institute's student data with entries like Ankita (101, PGDCA, 6 months), Ananya (102, Full Stack, 6 months), and Archita (103, BI, 8 months), we can define these keys:</p>
            
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Primary Key:</strong>
                    <p>This key uniquely identifies each record in a table. For our example, the "student ID" (101, 102, 103) can serve as the primary key since each student has a unique ID.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Candidate Key:</strong>
                    <p>These are columns that can uniquely identify records and can become primary keys. In our example, "student ID" is a candidate key because it uniquely identifies students.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Super Key:</strong>
                    <p>Any set of columns that can uniquely identify rows. Here, "student ID" alone is a super key. Also, combinations like ("student ID" + "name") are super keys, but they are unnecessarily complex.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Foreign Key:</strong>
                    <p>This key is used to link two tables together. If we have another table for courses where "course name" is the primary key, the "course" column in our student table could be a foreign key linking to the course table.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Composite Key:</strong>
                    <p>A key that consists of two or more columns to uniquely identify records. If "student ID" wasnâ€™t unique, we could use ("name" + "student ID") as a composite key.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Alternate Key:</strong>
                    <p>These are candidate keys that are not chosen as the primary key. If both "student ID" and another column could be candidate keys, the unused one becomes an alternate key.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </div>
    </body>
